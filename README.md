# FullStack-Course
This repository repreasents the work I have done and submitted to the "Deep Dive Into Modern Web Development"
The course is hosted by the University of Helsinki and serves as an introduction to modern web application development with JavaScript. 
The main focus is on building single page applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with Node.js.
The course also contains a section on GraphQL, a modern alternative to REST APIs.
The course covers testing, configuration and environment management, the use of databases for storing the applicationâ€™s data amongst other things.
